# S5E12 – Kaggle Playground Competition

This repository contains my first submission to a Kaggle competition. I placed **2015th out of 4,206 participants**.

I used this competition to practice the concepts from Kaggle’s *Intro to Machine Learning* course. In particular, I explored feature cardinality, applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables, and built a preprocessing + modeling workflow using **scikit-learn Pipelines**.

I experimented with several different models, compared their performance, and submitted the best one I found. My approach was intentionally exploratory: the goal was to understand how different models behave on the same feature set rather than to optimize aggressively for leaderboard position.
